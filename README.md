# Learning project

This project, completed during my computer science bachelor's degree, helped me understand how Symfony and Vue.js can work together using frameworks like API Platform and Webpack Encore. The project simulates a classic pizzeria, allowing users to create pizzas, ingredients, and more in an EasyAdmin-powered back office, then display them on the front end using Vue.js.

## Features

### Back Office (EasyAdmin):
- Create and manage pizzas, ingredients, and other menu items.

### Front End (Vue.js):
- Browse and view available pizzas.

## Technologies Used
- **Symfony**
- **Vue.js**
- **API Platform**
- **Webpack Encore**
- **EasyAdmin**
